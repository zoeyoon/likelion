            The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information 
            system enabling documents and other web resources to be accessed over 
            the Internet.[1]<br>
            Documents and downloadable media are made available 
            to the network through web servers and can be accessed 
            by programs such as web browsers. Servers and resources on the 
            World Wide Web are identified and located through character strings 
            called uniform resource locators (URLs). The original and still 
            very common document type is a web page formatted in Hypertext 
            Markup Language (HTML).
